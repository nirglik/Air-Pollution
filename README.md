Berlin Air Quality: When is it safe enough to engage in outdoor activities? 

Poor air quality, especially in urban areas, continues to affect the health of people around the world. We often see the news about the poor air quality in Beijing, New Delhi, or Teheran, but the danger of bad air quality also persists in Europe.  

According to the European Environmental Agency’s latest estimates, at least 238,000 people died prematurely in the EU in 2020 due to exposure to air polluters. 

The problem: The way air pollution is measured is complicated. This in turn makes it unclear and distant to the public. 
There are several indicators to take into account when measuring air quality. These are:

Name
	What it is
	Health effect 
	Particulate matter (PM)
	The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust, and water. 
	Exposure to such particles can affect both lungs and heart
	Ozone (O3)
	Ozone at ground level – not to be confused with the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere – is a major constituent of photochemical smog. It is formed by the reaction with the sunlight of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) from vehicle and industry emissions and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by vehicles, solvents, and industry. The highest levels of ozone pollution occur during periods of sunny weather.
	Asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases.
	Nitrogen dioxide
(NO2)
	NO2 is the main source of nitrate aerosols, which form an important fraction of PM2.5 and, in the presence of ultraviolet light, of ozone. The major sources of anthropogenic emissions of NO2 are combustion processes (heating, power generation, and engines in vehicles and ships).
	Asthma and bronchitis 
	Sulfur dioxide 
(SO2)
	SO2 is a colourless gas with a sharp odour. It is produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulfur. The main anthropogenic source of SO2 is the burning of sulfur-containing fossil fuels for domestic heating, power generation, and motor vehicles.
	Respiratory problems 
	Solution:
Visualise air pollution data in order to make it clearer and more accessible, and set recommendations for the public when levels are too risky for outdoor activities. 

Scope: 
In this project, we would like to use web scraping (API) to access 18 air quality monitoring stations in Berlin. They are updated regularly every couple of hours. In addition to visualising the up-to-date air pollution levels, we plan to also visualise the trend in air pollution in previous years.

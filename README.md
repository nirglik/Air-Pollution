Berlin Air Quality: When is it safe enough to engage in outdoor activities? 

Poor air quality, especially in urban areas, continues to affect the health of people around the world. We often see the news about the poor air quality in Beijing, New Delhi, or Teheran, but the danger of bad air quality also persists in Europe.  

According to the European Environmental Agencyâ€™s latest estimates, at least 238,000 people died prematurely in the EU in 2020 due to exposure to air polluters. 

The problem: The way air pollution is measured is complicated. This in turn makes it unclear and distant to the public. 
There are several indicators to take into account when measuring air quality. These are:

These are:
Particulate Matter (10, 2.5), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2),Sulfur dioxide (SO2)

	Respiratory problems 
	Solution:
Visualise air pollution data in order to make it clearer and more accessible, and set recommendations for the public when levels are too risky for outdoor activities. 

Scope: 
In this project, we would like to use web scraping (API) to access 18 air quality monitoring stations in Berlin. They are updated regularly every couple of hours. In addition to visualising the up-to-date air pollution levels, we plan to also visualise the trend in air pollution in previous years.
